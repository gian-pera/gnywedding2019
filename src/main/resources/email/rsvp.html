<p>To help you get started on preparing for our wedding, here are some guides and suggestions we'd like to share to you.</p>

<div>
  <h4>Getting to Bohol</h4>
  <p>Bohol is accessible both by air and sea. Several domestic airlines offer direct flights to Tagbilaran City, the capital of Bohol. You can also reach Bohol through passenger ships and ferries plying the routes between coastal cities and towns.</p>
  <p><b>By Air:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Air Asia</li>
      <li>Cebu Pacific</li>
      <li>Philippine Airlines</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p><b>By Sea:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Oceanjet</li>
      <li>Supercat</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>"We highly recommend registering to airline/cruiseline membership programmes to get updated on their latest events and promos"</p>

<div>
  <h4>Getting There</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Cebu Airport to Tagbilaran City</b> - After getting out of the Cebu Airport, there will be a line up of taxis.  The ride costs PHP200 for the trip to Pier 4. You will then have to take a ferry. All ferries take 90 minutes to get to Tagbilaran City. Schedules and fees can be found on the ferry's website (links in the "Getting There" section).
      <br><i><b>NOTE:</b>There are also planes that fly directly to Tagbilaran City Airport. There are scheduled flights from Mactan International Airport (Cebu) to Tagbilaran City, which takes about 25 minutes, while that from Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Manila) takes about 1 hour & 15 minutes.</i>
    </li>
    <li><b>Tagbilaran City to Panglao</b> - Once in Tagbilaran City, you may opt to either take a taxi or a tricycle (a small motorcycle cab) to your hotel. Taxis are few in Bohol so your best choice is to flag down a tricycle. Tricycles have no meters unlike taxis so you have to inform the driver of your destination and agree on a fixed rate. As a rule of thumb, you should pay no more than 7 pesos per kilometer for every trip, regardless of the number of passengers. For routes outside the city you may choose  to ride the jeepneys and multicabs.</li>
    <li><b>Panglao Island</b> - Guests going to Panglao Island, particularly Alona Beach, can have their hotel pick them up in Tagbilaran City airport or pier for an additional fee. Alternatively, they should be able to get a taxi at a reasonable cost between PHP400 to PHP600.
  </ol>
